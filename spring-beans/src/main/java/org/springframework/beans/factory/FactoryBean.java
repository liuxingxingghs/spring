/**
 * Interface to be implemented by objects used within a {@link BeanFactory} which
 * are themselves factories for individual objects. If a bean implements this
 * interface, it is used as a factory for an object to expose, not directly as a
 * bean instance that will be exposed itself.
 *
 * <p><b>NB: A bean that implements this interface cannot be used as a normal bean.</b>
 * A FactoryBean is defined in a bean style, but the object exposed for bean
 * references ({@link #getObject()}) is always the object that it creates.
 *
 * <p>FactoryBeans can support singletons and prototypes, and can either create
 * objects lazily on demand or eagerly on startup. The {@link SmartFactoryBean}
 * interface allows for exposing more fine-grained behavioral metadata.
 *
 * <p>This interface is heavily used within the framework itself, for example for
 * the AOP {@link org.springframework.aop.framework.ProxyFactoryBean} or the
 * {@link org.springframework.jndi.JndiObjectFactoryBean}. It can be used for
 * custom components as well; however, this is only common for infrastructure code.
 *
 * <p><b>{@code FactoryBean} is a programmatic contract. Implementations are not
 * supposed to rely on annotation-driven injection or other reflective facilities.</b>
 * {@link #getObjectType()} {@link #getObject()} invocations may arrive early in
 * the bootstrap process, even ahead of any post-processor setup. If you need access
 * other beans, implement {@link BeanFactoryAware} and obtain them programmatically.
 *
 * <p>Finally, FactoryBean objects participate in the containing BeanFactory's
 * synchronization of bean creation. There is usually no need for internal
 * synchronization other than for purposes of lazy initialization within the
 * FactoryBean itself (or the like).

当调用 getBean("Car")时，Spring 通过反射机制发现 CarFactoryBean 实现了FactoryBean的接口，
这时Spring容器就调用接口方法CarFactoryBean#getObject()方法返回。如果希望获取 CarFactoryBean的实例，
则需要在使用getBean(beanName)方法时在beanName前显示的加上
前缀，例如 getBean("&car")
